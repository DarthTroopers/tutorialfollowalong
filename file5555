this is file 5555 named after CT-5555 otherwise knows as clone trooper fives. Fives was born on Kamino around 32 BBY. Like almost every other clone he was genetically modified for combat and accelerated aging. He was a part of the Domino squad before joining the 501st legion in 22 BBY after most of his squad died in an outpost attack. He served in the battle of Kamino. He then became an arc trooper. He then participated in the citadel attack on Lola Sayu to rescue master Even Piell. During the mission his closest comrade Echo was caught in an explosion and presumed dead. However, the team still won the day, though at a high cost. In 20 BBY Fives served in the battle of Umbara. During the battle, a Jedi named Pon Krell who was secretly working for the Separatist commanded the 501st. His startegies intentionally resulted in many clone causlties. The clones eventually figured out his deception and captured then executed him. The Republic won the the battle in the end. In 19 BBY He served in the battle of Ringo Vinda. During this battle his friend Tup mysteriously killed a Jedi. This seemed tobe the result of a virus of some kind. Fives went with him to Kamino to investigate the cause of this behaviour. Little did Fives know the Kaminoans were trying to cover up a plot to turn the clones against the jedi. Tup died and Fives became suspicous of the Kaminoan intentions and investigated the Kaminoan archives. He was convinced by Master Shaak Ti to come to Corsucant to present his case to the Chancellor and Jedi Council.

 Fives died in 19 BBY on Coruscant. Palipantine declared that a parasite on Ringo Vinda was responsible for the actions of Fives and Tup to cver up the turth about Order 66. However, Rex kept a recording of Fives' story which would help him and Ahsoka survive Order 66.
